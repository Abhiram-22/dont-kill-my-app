explanation: "
Basically, For the apps to run in background(at all), They need a special permission called <strong>Autostart</strong>.
This might be turned on for all apps, mostly.<br>
and then there is another thing called <strong>Background Power consumption</strong>. Even though the "AutoStart" is turned on for a given app, the app may eventually get killed without you allowing the app to use power in the background.<br>

<strong>Conclusion</strong>:For a app to work as intended, you need to enable AutoStart and allow apps to use power in background.<br>
